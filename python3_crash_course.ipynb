    "* **Dictionaries** are similar to what their name suggests - a dictionary. In a dictionary, you have an 'index' of words, and for each of them a definition. In Python, the word is called a 'key', and the definition a 'value'. The values in a dictionary aren't numbered - they aren't in any specific order, either - the key does the same thing.

    "There are many other functions that help you with dealing with files. They have many uses that empower you to do more, and make the things you can do easier. Let's have a look at `tell()`, `readline()`, `readlines()`, `write()` and `close()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`tell()` returns where the cursor is in the file. It has no parameters, just type it in (like what the example below will show). This is infinitely useful, for knowing what you are referring to, where it is, and simple control of the cursor. To use it, type `fileobjectname.tell()` - where fileobjectname is the name of the file object you created when you opened the file (in `openfile = open('pathtofile', 'r')` the file object name is `openfile`).\n",
    "\n",
    "`readline()` reads from where the cursor is till the end of the line. Remember that the end of the line isn't the edge of your screen - the line ends when you press enter to create a new line. This is useful for things like reading a log of events, or going through something progressively to process it. There are no parameters you have to pass to `readline()`, though you can optionally tell it the maximum number of bytes/letters to read by putting a number in the brackets. Use it with `fileobjectname.readline()`.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "`readlines()` is much like `readline()`, however `readlines()` reads all the lines from the cursor onwards, and returns a list, with each list element holding a line of code. Use it with `fileobjectname.readlines()`. For example, if you had the text file:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Line 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Line 3\n",
    "Line 4\n",
    "\n",
    "Line 6\n",
    "```\n",
    "then the returned list from `readlines()` would be:<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "| Index | Value |\n",
    "| :--: | :--: |\n",
    "| 0 | 'Line 1' |\n",
    "| 1 | \" |\n",
    "| 2 | 'Line 3' |\n",
    "| 3 | 'Line 4' |\n",
    "| 4 | \" |\n",
    "| 5 | 'Line 6' |\n",
    "\n",
    "The `write()` function, writes to the file. How did you guess??? It writes from where the cursor is, and overwrites text in front of it - like in MS Word, where you press 'insert' and it writes over the top of old text. To utilize this most purposeful function, put a string between the brackets to write e.g. `fileobjectname.write('this is a string')`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`close`, you may figure, closes the file so that you can no longer read or write to it until you reopen in again. Simple enough. To use, you would write `fileobjectname.close()`. Simple!\n",
    "\n",
    "Later in the course you can try this in the Python command line. Open up a test file (or create a new one...) and play around with these functions. You can do some simple (and very inconvenient) text editing."
